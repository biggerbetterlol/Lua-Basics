# Variable Basics
// Variable is something you can call for an code. Variable is easy to make and you can name it anything. It mostly used for alternative
so it cna be easier to call something.

# Variable on prints
// Lets say our variable name is "MyVariable". Now to make this work we just need value for the variable.
MyVariable = Hello Word
// The code above give the variable a value. The value is "Hello Word". When we use it in prints it would be like this.
MyVariable = Hello Word
print(MyVariable)
// The line above will print "Hello Word". Why you may ask, basically we give the variable an value of "Hello Word". 
So when we print the MyVariable, it will print Hello Word because its the value of the variable.
// This will help so much on long words to make it more efficient. 

# Variable on function
// Variable on function is basically the same as prints. But the variable is just for calling the function. 
// Now example if say the variable is "MyFunction", we can call that to make the function work.
// Also dont forget to add () for the function.

# Variable on other things
// Variable can be used for almost everything and very important in programming. This is only the basics so you can understand for other advanced things.
