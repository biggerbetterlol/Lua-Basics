# If Statement
// If Statement is telling you when the conditions is true, then it will do what the code say. For example:
if 2 + 2 = 4
then
   print ("the addition is true")

// the line above is telling IF 2 = 2 = 4 then it should print  "the addition is ture".
// so it just telling a basic logic when the conditions is true then it should print that.

# Else Statement
// Else statement is telling you when the conditions is false, then it will do what the code say next.
if 2 + 2 = 4
then
   print ("the addition is true")
else
   print ("the addition is false")

// Else will work when we say 2 + 2 = 5
// It will skip if because its not true, so it will goes to else and say "the addition is false"

// These is only basics, its just introducting you so you can understand more later.
