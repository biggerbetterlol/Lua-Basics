# Function basics
// Function is an code inside code that works to make things more efficient. For example if we have many print codes lets say 10 of them.
Its not  gonna be efficient if we copy and paste the whole entire thing into the code. That's why function was made.
// Now lets make a basic function code so we can make it easy.

Function MyFunction()
  print("hello word")
end

MyFunction()

// Now that code above us is an code for function. Inside function there will be a code and ended with a "end".
// To make the function work, we can say "MyFunction()" like that above. It will make the function work based on the code inside.
// If we repeat that until 10 times, it will print the "hello word" 10 times. Why?
// Basically like i say when we call the code once it will make the function work once.
// So if we do it 10 times, it will make the function work 10 times based on the code inside.

// This is just an basics of function to make you more understand.
