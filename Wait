# Wait
// Wait is a code that will stop other code below it. It will stop with how much amount of time it give.
// For example, lets say we gonna make it 1 second. Then it would be like this.

Wait( 60 )
// The Wait function also uses milisecond so dont use "1" because it will make it 1 milisecond.
// Now if there a 2 print code like this:
print("hello")
wait( 60 )
print("hi")
// That code will stop the "hi" one. Why? Because above print "hi" code is a wait( 60 ) meaning 1 second. 
// So it will pause the hi print code for 1 second because the hi printcode is below the wait function.
